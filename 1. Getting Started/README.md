# What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

They are comprised of Neural Networks, inpired from the model of human brains. Just like human brain several of neurons are interconnected with each other in ANN.

Neurons in human brain can communicate in two ways -
1. Rate Coding(High Computational power is needed to run)
2. Tempral Coding(Works fine in Low Power)

Neuron inside a brain works on the model of IF(Integrate and Fire)

# Neural Network equivalent to Linear Regression

$$
    Loss Function = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \left[(\theta_0 + \theta^T) - Y_i\right]^2}{N}
$$
