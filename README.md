# Deep Learning Practical Guide

This repository will contain all the information about Deep Learning, **one single source for The Deep Learning** :grinning: . As I'm Starting this ofcourse this will take time, please contribute to make it a great repository.

After this you don't have to wander anywhere to know about Deep Learning, it's new Algorithms, research work, examples, all that concisely and simply encapsulated in a single source.
