# How to use this template?
Fork it, and whenever you make new repository clone the gist into the project folder, in my case

```
git clone https://gist.github.com/vipul02/01bf7512fc3035124b0076b27d4c9d6c
```

Read why we write [README.md](https://gist.github.com/vipul02/1b096cbbd54c0bc1a8af87d0200f11c6)

P.S. Remove above after forking.
